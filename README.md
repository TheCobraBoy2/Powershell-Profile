I might actually create a readme later but right now its really simple i have hardly even began working on it.
So just read through the code to figure out how it works.
I might add comments later down the road

I havent added support for the "Description" tag in the json. And later i will add a help command that will give you information on either an entire module or a single function.

Again i have been working on this profile for maybe 25 minutes so not much yet
